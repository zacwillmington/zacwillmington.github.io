<p>Hi, I’m Zac and I am an aspiring web developer living in San Diego, USA. I was born and raised in Australia and lived there until fall 2015 (and yes, I know what you’re thinking, I do throw shrimps on the barbie, but we call them prawns).</p>

<p>I found my deep passion for programming at the end of 2016 and since then I have been consuming as much information as I possible and loving every moment of the process. I have a good working knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS and I am eagerly learning Ruby.</p>

<p>What I most enjoy about developing software is the challenge of solving problems,  which pushes me to develop my skills and express my ideas through code.</p>
